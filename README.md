The goal with kanemi is to provide a library and tools to work more easily with KNMI data.

> Warning: LOOK MA! I'M DOING RUST!!!! (This repo is a learning project for Rust, no guarantees for the quality)

## Testimonials

- "I'm not sure what this is, but it looks cool" - Mom
- "Since I started using kanemi, my wife and dog moved back in with me" - TheDude22
- "kanemi told me it was going to rain. I went out without an umbrella. It didnâ€™t rain. So... thanks for making me look like an idiot." - StevenSeagul
- "kanemi: Finally, a way to make forecasts as accurate as flipping a coin." - NotImpressed44
- "LET'S GO!!! PRICIPITATION FORECASTING AND MUCH MORE WITH KANEMI, BABY!!!" - SteveBall

## Datasets

Kanemi tries to provide easy access to the following datasets

### Nowcast precipitation forecast

[Nowcast precipitation forecast](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/radar-forecast-2-0) up to 2 hours ahead, per 5 minutes, over the Netherlands. The forecast contains 25 time steps: +0 minutes to +120 minutes. Forecasted is the precipitation sum per 5 minutes, on a grid of 1x1 km. The forecast is made with an operational KNMI implementation of pySTEPS. The forecast is initiated with the KNMI 5-minute real-time precipitation accumulation product: RTCOR-5m.

### HARMONIE-AROME Cy43 forecasts Netherlands

ToDo

### Meteo data - actual synoptic observations

ToDo

## Features

- Using the KNMI Data Platform
- Using the KNMI notification service (work in progress)
- Nowcast precipitation forecast
  - Load dataset from HDF5 files
  - Projection conversion between the HDF5 grid and EPSG:4326 (both directions)
  - Read image data and their time attribute
  - Get pixel values and mm/hr for a specific location (xy/lonlat)
- Simple CLI tool only for demonstration currently

## Roadmap

- CLI tool
- More datasets
- Webservice
- Converters
- Geocoder (PDOK Locatieserver)

## Prerequisites

### HDF5

HDF5 library is required to run and build knmi-nowcast. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install libhdf5-dev
```

### KNMI API key

#### Open Data API
To fetch the nowcast data, you need an API key from the KNMI. You can find more information [here](https://developer.dataplatform.knmi.nl/open-data-api#token). An anonymous key is available on the mentioned page aswell.

#### Notifications

For the notifications service a different API key is needed and can be requested like the Open Data API key.

## kanecli - CLI Tool

For now the CLI only contains 3 simple test commands to test the notification service, get precipitation forecast and geocoding. Every command accepts it's own set of args, check the args with the `--help` flag on an option. `kanecli forecast --help` for example.

```bash
A CLI tool to work with KNMI data and maybe some other stuff

Usage: kanecli <COMMAND>

Commands:
  forecast       Print the precipitation forecast from input file or a newly downloaded KNMI dataset
  notifications  Test the notification service
  geocoder       Geocode or reverse geocode a location using the PDOK Locatieserver
  help           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Installation

To install kanecli, clone the repository and build the project with cargo. This will install the binary in the cargo bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tebben/kanemi.git
cd kanemi
cargo install --path kanecli
```

### Examples

Download the latest forecast and return the precipitation forecast for the given location.

```bash
kanecli forecast -a <your-api-key> -l "<longitude>,<latitude>"
```

Geocode a location using the PDOK Locatieserver, filter on address type and return only the best match.

```bash
kanecli geocoder free -q "museumstraat 1 Amsterdam" --fq "type:adres" --best-match
```

Reverse geocode, find the 5 best adres matches for the given lonlat within 15 meters.

```bash
kanecli geocoder reverse --lonlat "4.887295127944717,52.36849110206849" --rows 5 --distance 15
```

### Building the CLI

```bash
cargo build --release
```
