# knmi-nowcast

Nowcast precipitation forecast up to 2 hours ahead, per 5 minutes, over the Netherlands. The forecast contains 25 time steps: +0 minutes to +120 minutes. Forecasted is the precipitation sum per 5 minutes, on a grid of 1x1 km. The forecast is made with an operational KNMI implementation of pySTEPS. The forecast is initiated with the KNMI 5-minute real-time precipitation accumulation product: RTCOR-5m.

The goal is to provide a library to fetch and work with the KNMI nowcast precipitation forecast data and some tools to use it.

> Warning: LOOK MA! I'M DOING RUST!!!!

## Testimonials

- "I'm not sure what this is, but it looks cool" - Mom
- "Since I started using knmi-nowcast, my wife and dog moved back in with me" - TheDude22
- "Knmi-nowcast told me it was going to rain. I went out without an umbrella. It didnâ€™t rain. So... thanks for making me look like an idiot." - StevenSeagul
- "Knmi-nowcast: Finally, a way to make precipitation predictions as accurate as flipping a coin." - NotImpressed44
- "LET'S GO!!! PRICIPITATION FORECASTING WITH KNMI-NOWCAST, BABY!!!" - SteveBall

## Not frequently asked questions

### Is the KNMI nowcast precipitation forecast better than buienradar/buienalarm?

I have no idea which data those services are using, this is not clear from their websites. If you have a rain sensor in your backyard you can measure and let me know.

### What is the quality of the code?

This is my first venture into rust so it's probably not great. I'm open to suggestions and PRs. But I'm also lazy so I might not do anything with them.

## Features

- Fetch latest file from KNMI Data Platform
- Load dataset from file
- Projection conversion between the HDF5 grid and EPSG:4326 (both directions)
- Read image data and their time attribute
- Get pixel values and mm/hr for a specific location (xy/lonlat)
- Simple CLI tool for demonstration
- Notifications for dataset updates trough KNMI notifications server

## Roadmap

- CLI tool
  - Static link the HDF5 library
  - command: forecast
    - format [json, csv, parquet]
  - command: convert
    - format [csv, geotiff, parquet]
  - command: tui
    - Graph with live updates
- Web server to provide the forecast data as a service
- Converters for other formats

## Prerequisites

### HDF5

HDF5 library is required to run and build knmi-nowcast. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install libhdf5-dev
```

### KNMI API key

#### Open Data API
To fetch the nowcast data, you need an API key from the KNMI. You can find more information [here](https://developer.dataplatform.knmi.nl/open-data-api#token). An anonymous key is available on the previous mentioned page aswell.

#### Notifications

For the notifications service a different API key is needed and can be requested like the Open Data API key. Place this key in the `.env` file aswell.

## CLI Tool

For now the CLI only contains 2 simple test commands to test the notification service and to get the precipitation forecast. Every command accepts it's own set of args, check the args with the `--help` flag on an option. `cargo run -- forecase --help` for example. All args can also be set using environment variables trough the system or a `.env` file.

```bash
A CLI tool to get KNMI precipitation forecasts

Usage: knmi-cli <COMMAND>

Commands:
  forecast       Print the precipitation forecast from input file or a newly downloaded KNMI dataset
  notifications  Test the notification service
  help           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Running the CLI

This will download the latest forecast and return the precipitation forecast for the given location.

```bash
cargo run -- forecast -a <your-api-key> -l "<longitude>,<latitude>"
```

### Building the CLI

```bash
cargo build --release
```
